1. [ ]  If necessary, log in to your Azure portal using your Azure account credentials.

    If you have more than one Azure account, be sure that you are logged in with the account that is tied to the subscription that you will be using for this course.

1. [ ] Open the Azure Cloud Shell by clicking the **Terminal** icon within the top header bar of the Azure portal, and select the **Bash** shell option.

1. [ ] Run the following Azure CLI command to create an **IoT Edge Device Identity** in Azure IoT Hub with the **Device ID** set to `myEdgeDevice`.

    ```cmd/sh
    az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name {IoTHubName} --device-id myEdgeDevice --edge-enabled
    ```

    Be sure to replace the `{IoTHubName}` placeholder with the name of the Azure IoT Hub in your subscription.
@@@warning
**Note**: The IoT Edge Device Identity can also be created using the Azure Portal by navigating to **IoT Hub** -> **IoT Edge** -> **Add an IoT Edge device**.
@@@

1. [ ] Notice the output of the command contains information about the **Device Identity** that was created for the IoT Edge device. For example, you can see it defaults to `symmetricKey` authentication with auto-generated keys, and the `iotEdge` capability is set to `true` as indicated by the `--edge-enabled` parameter that was specified.

    ```json
        {
          "authentication": {
            "symmetricKey": {
              "primaryKey": "jftBfeefPsXgrd87UcotVKJ88kBl5Zjk1oWmMwwxlME=",
              "secondaryKey": "vbegAag/mTJReQjNvuEM9HEe1zpGPnGI2j6DJ7nECxo="
            },
            "type": "sas",
            "x509Thumbprint": {
              "primaryThumbprint": null,
              "secondaryThumbprint": null
            }
          },
          "capabilities": {
            "iotEdge": true
          },
          "cloudToDeviceMessageCount": 0,
          "connectionState": "Disconnected",
          "connectionStateUpdatedTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00",
          "deviceId": "myEdgeDevice",
          "deviceScope": "ms-azure-iot-edge://myEdgeDevice-637093398936580016",
          "etag": "OTg0MjI1NzE1",
          "generationId": "637093398936580016",
          "lastActivityTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00",
          "status": "enabled",
          "statusReason": null,
          "statusUpdatedTime": "0001-01-01T00:00:00"
        }
    ```

1. [ ] Once the IoT Edge Device Identity has been created, you can access the **Connection String** for the device by running the following Azure CLI command.

    ```cmd/sh
    az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --device-id myEdgeDevice --hub-name {IoTHubName}
    ```

    Replace the `{IoTHubName}` placeholder with the name of the Azure IoT Hub in your subscription.

1. [ ] Copy the value of the `connectionString` from the JSON output of the command, and save it for reference later. This connection string will be used to configure the IoT Edge device to connect to IoT Hub.

    ```json
        {
          "connectionString": "HostName={IoTHubName}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=myEdgeDevice;SharedAccessKey=jftBfeefPsXgrd87UcotVKJ88kBl5Zjk1oWmMwwxlME="
        }
    ```
@@@warning
**Note**: The IoT Edge Device Connection String can also be accessed within the Azure Portal, by navigating to **IoT Hub** -> **IoT Edge** -> **Your Edge Device** -> **Connection String (primary key)**

#### Exercise 4: Connect IoT Edge Device to IoT Hub

@@@secondary
In this exercise, you will connect the IoT Edge Device to Azure IoT Hub.
@@@

1. [ ] Navigate to the `AZ-220-VM-EDGE` IoT Edge virtual machine within the Azure Portal.

1. [ ] On the **Overview** pane of the **Virtual machine** blade, click the **Connect** button at the top.

1. [ ] Within the **Connect to virtual machine** pane, select the **SSH** option, then copy the **Login using VM local account** value.

    This is a sample SSH command that will be used to connect to the virtual machine that contains the IP Address for the VM and the Administrator username. The command is formatted similar to `ssh demouser@52.170.205.79`.

1. [ ] At the top of the Azure Portal click on the **Cloud Shell** icon to open up the **Azure Cloud Shell** within the Azure Portal. When the pane opens, choose the option for the **Bash** terminal within the Cloud Shell.

1. [ ] Within the Cloud Shell, paste in the `ssh` command that was copied, and press **Enter**.

1. [ ]  When prompted with **Are you sure you want to continue connecting?**, type `yes` and press Enter. This prompt is a security confirmation since the certificate used to secure the connection to the VM is self-signed. The answer to this prompt will be remembered for subsequent connections, and is only prompted on the first connection.

1. [ ] When prompted to enter the password, enter the Administrator password that was entered when the VM was provisioned.

1. [ ] Once connected, the terminal will change to show the name of the Linux VM, similar to the following. This tells you which VM you are connected to.

    ```cmd/sh
    demouser@AZ-220-VM-EDGE:~$
    ```

1. [ ] To confirm that the Azure IoT Edge Runtime is installed on the VM, run the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    iotedge version
    ```

    This command will output the version of the Azure IoT Edge Runtime that is currently installed on the virtual machine.

1. [ ]  You will need to run the command to configure the Edge device to connect to IoT Hub as Administrator. Run the following `sudo` command to elevate the terminal to run as Administrator:

    ```cmd/sh
    sudo su -
    ```
@@@warning
**Note**: You will see the user id change in the shell prompt: `root@AZ-220-VM-EDGE:~$`
@@@

1. [ ] The `/etc/iotedge/configedge.sh` script is used to configure the Edge device with the Connection String necessary to connect it to Azure IoT Hub. This script is installed as part of the Azure IoT Edge Runtime.

1. [ ] To configure the Edge device with the **Device Connection String** for Azure IoT Hub that was copied when the IoT Edge Device ID was created, run the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    /etc/iotedge/configedge.sh "{iot-edge-device-connection-string}"
    ```

    Be sure to replace the `{iot-edge-device-connection-string}` placeholder with the Connection String you copied previously for your IoT Edge Device.

1. [ ] Once this command completes, the IoT Edge Device will be configured to connect to Azure IoT Hub using the **Connection String** that was entered. The command will output a `Connection string set to ...` message that includes the Connection String that was set.


#### Exercise 5: Add Edge Module to Edge Device

@@@secondary
In this unit you will add a Simulated Temperature Sensor as a custom IoT Edge Module, and deploy it to run on the IoT Edge Device.
@@@

1. [ ] If necessary, log in to your Azure portal using your Azure account credentials.

1. [ ] Leave all values as their defaults, and close the **IoT Edge Custom Modules** pane.

1. [ ] Click **Next: Routes >**.

1. [ ] On the **Specify Routes** step, notice the existing routing is displayed.

1. [ ] Replace the default routes defined with the following three routes:

- Route 1
	- Name: telemetryToCloud
	- Value: FROM /messages/modules/tempsensor/* INTO $upstream
- Route 2
	- Name: alertsToReset
	- Value: FROM /messages/modules/AZ-220-ASA-{YOUR-ID}/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint("/modules/tempsensor/inputs/control")
- Route 3
	- Name: telemetryToAsa
	- Value: FROM /messages/modules/tempsensor/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint("/modules/AZ-220-ASA-{YOUR-ID}/inputs/temperature")


<!--
This is the original route info that was replaced by the above on advice of ticket
https://godeploy.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/14734

    - Route 1
        - Name: **telemetryToCloud**
        - Value: `FROM /messages/modules/tempsensor/* INTO $upstream`
    - Route 2
        - Name: **alertsToReset**
        - Value: `FROM /messages/modules/AZ-220-ASA-{YOUR-ID}/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/tempsensor/inputs/control\")`
    - Route 3
        - Name: **telemetryToAsa**
        - Value: `FROM /messages/modules/tempsensor/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/AZ-220-ASA-{YOUR-ID}/inputs/temperature\")`
        -->

    Be sure to replace the `AZ-220-ASA-{YOUR-ID}` placeholder with the name of your Azure Stream Analytics job module. You can click **Previous** to view the list of modules and their names, then click **Next** to come back to this step.

    The routes being defined are as follows:

    - The **telemetryToCloud** route sends the all messages from the `tempsensor` module output to Azure IoT Hub.
    - The **alertsToReset** route sends all alert messages from the Stream Analytics Module output to the input of the **tempsensor** module.
    - The **telemetryToAsa** route sends all messages from the `tempsensor` module output to the Stream Analytics Module input.

1. [ ] Click **Next: Review + create >**.

1. [ ] On the **Review + create** tab, notice the **Deployment Manifest** JSON is now updated with the Stream Analytics module and the routing definition that was just configured.

1. [ ] Notice the JSON configuration for the `tempsensor` Simulated Temperature Sensor module:

    ```json
    "tempsensor": {
        "settings": {
            "image": "asaedgedockerhubtest/asa-edge-test-module:simulated-temperature-sensor",
            "createOptions": ""
        },
        "type": "docker",
        "version": "1.0",
        "status": "running",
        "restartPolicy": "always"
    },
    ```

1. [ ] Notice the JSON configuration for the routes that were previously configured, and how they are configured in the JSON Deployment definition:

    ```json
    "$edgeHub": {
        "properties.desired": {
            "routes": {
                "telemetryToCloud": "FROM /messages/modules/tempsensor/* INTO $upstream",
                "alertsToReset": "FROM /messages/modules/AZ-220-ASA-CP122619/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\\\"/modules/tempsensor/inputs/control\\\")",
                "telemetryToAsa": "FROM /messages/modules/tempsensor/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\\\"/modules/AZ-220-ASA-CP122619/inputs/temperature\\\")"
            },
            "schemaVersion": "1.0",
            "storeAndForwardConfiguration": {
                "timeToLiveSecs": 7200
            }
        }
    },
    ```

1. [ ] Click **Create**.

#### Task 6 - View Data

1. [ ] Go back to the **Cloud Shell** session where you're connected to the **IoT Edge Device** over **SSH**.

1. [ ] Run the following command to view a list of the modules deployed to the device:

    ```cmd/sh
    iotedge list
    ```

    It can take a minute for the new Stream Analytics module to be deployed to the IoT Edge Device. Once it's there, you will see it in the list output by this command.

    ```cmd/sh
    demouser@AZ-220-VM-EDGE:~$ iotedge list
    NAME               STATUS           DESCRIPTION      CONFIG
    AZ-220-ASA-CP1119  running          Up a minute      mcr.microsoft.com/azure-stream-analytics/azureiotedge:1.0.5
    edgeAgent          running          Up 6 hours       mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-agent:1.0
    edgeHub            running          Up 4 hours       mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-hub:1.0
    tempsensor         running          Up 4 hours       asaedgedockerhubtest/asa-edge-test-module:simulated-temperature-sensor
    ```
@@@warning
**Note**: If the Stream Analytics module does not show up in the list, wait a minute or two, then try again. It can take a minute for the module deployment to be updated on the IoT Edge Device.
@@@

1. [ ]  Run the `iotedge log` command within the Azure Cloud Shell SSH session on the **IoT Edge Device** to watch the telemetry being sent by the `tempsensor` Simulated Temperature Sensor module:

    ```cmd/sh
    iotedge logs tempsensor
    ```

1. [ ]  Notice that while watching the temperature telemetry being sent by **tempsensor**, you will see the **reset** command sent by the Stream Analytics job when the `machine.temperature` reaches an average above `500` as configured in the Stream Analytics job query.

    Output of this event will look similar to the following:

    ```cmd/sh
